## Key Development Principles

### **Phase Independence**
- Each phase builds on previous phases but is complete in itself
- No partial implementations across phases
- Each phase can be tested and demonstrated independently

### **Sequential Dependencies**
- Phase N+1 requires Phase N to be complete
- No need to build Phase VI before Phase III
- Everything builds in logical sequence

### **No Backtracking**
- No need to revisit previous phases once complete
- Each phase delivers 100% of its scope
- Complete functionality at each stage

### **Testing Strategy**
- Each phase maintains application in fully functional state
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Real-time validation and user feedback

This plan ensures each phase delivers a complete, working feature that enhances the invoice generator without leaving any incomplete functionality, while maintaining the app's core principles of privacy, simplicity, and professional output.
